Autonomous HR Leave Management System

A production-style backend system that manages employee leave requests using a combination of agentic AI workflows and a stateful approval lifecycle. Built with FastAPI, Gemini (LLM), and clean backend architecture principles.

This is not a CRUD demo. The goal of this project is to demonstrate how AI agents can orchestrate real business workflows end-to-end.


🧠 Core Concepts Demonstrated
1. Agentic AI Workflow (Think → Act → Observe)

The LeaveManagementAgent uses an LLM (Gemini) to:
Reason about the user's intent
Decide which tool to call next
Observe tool output
Continue until the task is complete

This mirrors real autonomous agent behavior, not prompt-response chat.

2. Stateful Leave Lifecycle
Leave requests move through defined states:
PENDING_APPROVAL → APPROVED → (Leave Deducted)
                 → DENIED
State is stored in an in-memory database (RequestStateDB), simulating how real HR systems track workflow progress.

3. Manager Approval via Email Actions

Managers receive real emails containing approval and denial links.
Clicking a link:
Updates request state
Triggers final agentic actions
Notifies the employee automatically

🧩 Tech Stack

FastAPI – Backend API
Python 3.10+
Gemini LLM – Agent reasoning
SMTP (Gmail) – Email notifications
Pydantic – Data validation

🔌 API Endpoints
1️⃣ Request Leave
POST /request-leave
Creates a leave request and notifies the manager.

2️⃣ Handle Approval
GET /handle-approval?request_id=...&action=approve|deny
Triggered via manager email links.

3️⃣ Check Request Status
GET /request-status/{request_id}
Returns current request state.

🔐 Environment Variables

Create a .env file:
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key
SENDER_EMAIL=your_email@gmail.com
SENDER_PASSWORD=your_app_password

Gmail requires App Passwords (not your actual password).

▶️ Running the Project

❗ Why This Project Matters

Most AI projects stop at prompt engineering.

This project shows:
How AI agents drive backend logic
How workflows persist beyond a single request
How to combine LLM reasoning with deterministic systems
This is the kind of architecture used in real internal tools, not tutorials.

🧪 Limitations (Intentional)
In-memory DBs (easy to replace with PostgreSQL)
No auth layer
Single-service design
These were skipped to focus on agentic workflow design.

📌 Future Improvements
Persistent database
Role-based authentication
Background task queues (Celery / Redis)
UI dashboard
Multi-agent coordination
