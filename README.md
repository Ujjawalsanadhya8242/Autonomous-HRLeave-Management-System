# Autonomous-HRLeave-Management-System
A production-style HR leave management backend built with FastAPI, combining agentic LLM workflows (Gemini) with a stateful approval system.  The system handles end-to-end leave requests: validating balances, creating approval workflows, notifying managers via email, tracking request state, and finalizing decisions with automated actions.
